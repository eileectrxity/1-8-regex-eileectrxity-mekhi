# Question

Why would you want to use a `\b` character class instead of a `\s` character class?

# Answer

`\b` is used for when you want to isolate a phrase even when it's connected to other letters. For example for Question 3: `hasCatOrDogs`, if `/\bcat\b|\bdog\b/` were to be used, strings that do not include `cat` or `dog` specifically would not return true. If the string included `cats` or `dogs` it would not evaluate to be true. `\s` is not able to get as specific as `\b` can.
