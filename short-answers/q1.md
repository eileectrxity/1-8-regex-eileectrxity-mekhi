# Question

`replaceAll` is a handy new function that will match all instances of a given pattern. But what is the regex that will allow `replace` to get _all_ instances of a pattern?

# Answer

You will have to add the global flag to the regex in order to get all instances of the pattern. The global flag can be added by doing this:

```js
/ /g;
```
