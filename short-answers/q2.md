# Question
What's an example of when RegEx would solve a problem that would be difficult to solve with other tools?

# Answer
When you have to ensure that a user signs up to a website with a valid email, not using RegEx would make the check far more difficult. RegEx can basically be used as an precise and more powerful .includes() function for ensuring all of the essential parts of an email address are in the right place.
